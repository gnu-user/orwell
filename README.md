Beware of Big Brother
==============================

Orwell
------------------------------

Orwell is an easy to use Java library which provides cryptographic and privacy 
functionality for the pathologically paranoid. Orwell initially started off as
the cryptographic library for [Tinfoil-SMS](https://github.com/tinfoilhat/tinfoil-sms)
as we did not see any cryptographic library that provided the level of security and 
privacy we wanted.


Background
------------------------------

Orwell uses the excellent [Bouncy Castle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html) library
as a basis for much of the functionality provided, with enhancements made to improve the 
security of the block ciphers used.
